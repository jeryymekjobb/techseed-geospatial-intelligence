# Project Context

Project: TechSeed Geospatial Intelligence

## Purpose

Develop the concept for a short, repeatable exhibition demonstrator showing how space-derived observations, geospatial information, IoT sensors, connectivity and AI could combine into an operational situation picture.

## Current Direction

- Focus the initial demonstrator on a clear 2–3 minute scenario rather than a complete operations-room product.
- Use the IoTDagen concept in `onepager.md` as the current user-provided starting point.
- Keep real, simulated and proposed data sources distinguishable in the demonstrator and its explanations.
- Prioritize a stable, repeatable operator-controlled scenario and evidence-linked AI assessment over breadth of integrations.
- Treat implementation choices and estimates in the one-pager as proposals, not approved architecture or verified commitments.
- A working prototype exists in `app/`: the Västmanland 2014 wildfire replayed from NASA FIRMS archive data on a 2D map and a CesiumJS globe, with mission control, simulated SATCOM outage, IoT, a traceable assessment and PostGIS questions. Västmanland 2014 is the prototype's scenario; it has not been recorded as a formal MVP decision.
- The 3D globe shows the 2014 satellites (Terra, Aqua, Suomi NPP, Landsat 8, ISS) at the scenario clock from Space-Track element sets; the positions are computed, not observed, and are checked against the FIRMS detection times.
- Decided 2026-10-04: for the exhibition demo the booth IoT nodes run simulated (`tools/mqtt_node_sim.py`) and are shown as simulated. Questions that only concern a real implementation are deferred to the backlog.

## Backlog

- Firmware for the booth nodes: nRF91 board, nRF Connect SDK version, Wi-Fi fallback.
- Exposing and securing the MQTT broker for real nodes (network, passwords or certificates).
- A real 1 h forecast horizon for +60 MIN (the forecast has 3, 6, 12 and 24 h).
- GOD VIEW in 2D needs a wider offline base map; the 3D globe works.
- Check Space-Track's user agreement for showing positions computed from its element sets in public at the exhibition.

## Boundaries

- This repository contains professional TechSeed work; apply the confidentiality and data-handling rules in `AGENTS.md`.
- Do not imply that illustrative event data or simulated integrations are live feeds.
- Record material assumptions and data-source limitations before relying on them in design or demonstrations.

## Open Questions

- Which scenario, geographic area and audience interaction should be the MVP baseline?
- Which data sources are approved for the demonstration? (Physical IoT devices are not needed for the demo; see the decision above.)
- Decision B3: may the OSM power grid be shown, and may partner names (Dacreo, BruhnBruhn) be used? Until then there is no power grid and the texts are generic.
- Which layers can be sourced live, and which should be explicitly simulated?
- What are the accepted data licensing, attribution, update, and network requirements?
- Which AI assessments and spatial queries must be demonstrably traceable to source observations?
